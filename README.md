# RubiksCubeDemo

This a demo of Rubik's Cube face rotations in a 2D exploded view.

## Building and Running

This is a .NET 6 Winforms program.  

To build clone the repository, or alternatively download the ZIP file, and open the solution in Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.

There are no external dependencies so the program can be run directly from Visual Studio either with debugging (F5) or without (Ctrl + f5).  

Alternatively you can publish the 'RubiksCubeDemo' project to a local folder Target.  To do this, right-click the project and select 'Publish' from the context menu. Select the 'Folder' Target and follow the on-screen prompts to select a target destination folder.

If running via Publish, navigate to the selected destination folder and run 'RubiksCubeDemo.exe'

## Using the Program

This demo is designed to imitate the rotations of the exploded view tab of the [Rubik's Cube Solver](https://rubiks-cube-solver.com/) website.

Each button will rotate the faces as per the indicated Rubik's Cube move notation.  Pressing Reset will return the exploded cube view to it's solved state.
